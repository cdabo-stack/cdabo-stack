Hello!

My name is Carrina and I study Data Science and Economics. I am an aspiring Data Analyst and enjoy watching sports (especially soccer) and 
learning about urban planning, architecture & design in my free time. I'm in the process of creating and bolstering my portfolio at the moment,
and everything I work on will be posted here!
